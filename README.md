Overview of the project
Project: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR
Objective
The objective of a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring project using a DHT sensor is to design and implement a system that accurately measures and displays real-time temperature and humidity levels. This project typically involves the following goals:
Measurement Accuracy: Ensure the system accurately captures temperature and humidity readings.
Data Display: Provide a clear and user-friendly display of the measured data, either through an LCD screen, LED display, or a web interface
Scalability: Make the system easily scalable for multiple sensors or larger areas.
Power Efficiency: Design the system to be power-efficient, especially if it's intended for long-term monitoring.
